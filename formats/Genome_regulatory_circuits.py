# ### Exercise 1 <a class="anchor" id="Exercise-1"></a>
# 
# **Consider a gene whose expression is affected by a direct positive feedback, with Hill coefficient 2, maximum expression rate 1 nM/s, activation threshold 100 nM, and degradation rate 0.001 s-1. Integrate the differential equation that represents the dynamics of the concentration of the expressed protein, and determine the threshold value of the initial condition that separates the basins of attraction of the two coexisting equilibrium states of the system.**

# First, store the values given in the exercise in the corresponding variables:

# In[2]:


# Hill coefficient
n=2
# Maximum expression rate
b=1
# Activation threshold
K = 100
# Degradation rate
y=0.001


# Let's define the function which return dx/dt:

    """
    Positive feedback model, Hill cooperativity. Ex1
    """
    dxdt = ((b*x**n)/(K**n+ x**n))-y*x
    return dxdt


# Now define the time intervals and the initial conditios X0.

#time state
t = np.linspace(0, 15000, 1000)

x0=[9, 10, 11,1000]


# Plot x in function of the time for each initial condition. In this exercises, the integration will be done with scipy.integrate.odeint, which takes three arguments in this occasion: a function name that returns derivative values at requested y and t values (dx_dt), the initial conditions of the differential states (x), and the time points at which the solution should be reported (t):

# The plots show two equilibrium points: one around 0 nM and 989.898 nM approximately. Note that, when the starting concentration is larger than the second equilibrium point, it will decrease, and if it is smaller (but larger that 10 aprox.) it will increase, which it is expected from an attractor point.
# 
# The threshold value lies between 10 and 11 approximately, as showed above. We can try to close up alittle bit more in that interval:

# In this system we have the combination of possitive and negative feedback, ComK and ComS respectivelly.
# 
# Observing the plot above, we can notice that when the basal expression rate of ComK gets lower the concentration of ComS does not change whereas the concentration of ComK gets lower as well. For instance, when:
# Œ±k = 0.00875 and Œ±k = 0.0009 the concentration of ComS is 413.235 mM. This may be the reason that there are not oscillation behavior of the system since the ComS is supressing the expression of ComK in a negative feedback. That stable fixed point corresponds to the vegetative state.
# 
# However when the basal expression rate of ComK gets higher values ( Œ±k = 0.0875 to 0.875) we can notice that the concentration of ComS decrease significantly (from 57.728 to 0.448) while the concentration on ComK gets much higher (from 966.518 to 5548.956 mM). These may be because the ComS is not expressed enough to inhibit the expression of ComK. Also, we can see that within these values the system is unstable. The system exhibits limit cycle oscillations between a mid-ComK and a high-ComK level. In this case oscillation of the system is clearer to see. In contrast, with lower values of Œ±k there are not oscillation, we can see that the curve tends to the 400 mM and there not a recirculation of the reaction. But when Œ±k get higher values than 0.5 the oscillation dissapear and the system reach a higher concentration of ComK but it stays in a stable state whitout concentration changes in ComS and ComK.

# Observing the behaviour of the system when we change the value of the basal expression rate of ComS, we can notice that raising the value form 0.0004 to 0.8 the concentration of comS increase significantly faster than the concentration of ComK. Once these concentration get its maximum value they stay in a stable state. In other words, they do not change along the time. So, it makes sense that there are not oscillation in the system. However, once the Œ±s is higher than 0.85 the behaviour changes. Now we can see that the concentration of ComK increase sharply from 0 to 74500 nm at a certain moment of time, whereas the concentration of ComS remains the same all the time. Although, we can also notice that the higher is the Œ±s the higher concentration values comes gets while the max concentration of ComK doesn't change, but the time in which comic reach its maximum concentration gets smaller.
# In addition, we can notice that the change of the Œ±s does not produce any oscillation state or unstable state.

# In the first plot we can see that when we low the Œ≤s value the concentration of ComS and ComK decrease significantly, but the first one does it faster than the other one. As we can see that the concentration of ComK get higher values. Also, we can see that the there is not oscillation state, the plot of ComK vs ComS is just a straight line.We can notice that when Œ≤s increase its value from 0.06 to 0.92 the concentration of ComS increase extremely fast and the concentration of ComK increase slowly. Within these values the system reaches a steady state without changes and no-oscillation.
# 
# However, when Œ≤s gets values higher than 0.92 we can start seeing some changes. The concentration of ComK stays lower than ComS but at a certain moment the concentration of ComK increase sharply and as soon as this happens the concentration of ComS drops to the minim. Also, in the following cases we can easily see that this sharp concentration raise happens earlier when Œ≤s gets higher values. In addition, we can notice that when Œ≤s get higher values such as 2 and 10, the concentration on ComS tends to be higher than ComK from the first period of time and suddenly ComK raises its concentration to its maximum and ComS drops its concentration. Also, it is seen how the concentration of ComK becomes unstable which it can been seen in the oscillation plot how the system is unstable.
# We can also say that the pick which is seen in the "ComK vs ComS" plot when Œ≤s= 2 and Œ≤s= 10 is due to this both changes of concentration.
